### Alzheimer's Disease using Machine Learning
This is a project that I made using [Alzheimer's Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/daniilkrasnoproshin/alzheimers-disease-and-healthy-aging-data) for an assignment given to us. This project has helped me learn about machine learning algorithms and understand Machine Learning better.
